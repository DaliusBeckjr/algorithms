# algorithms
 these are algorithms that will be seperated from answering in javascript and also answering each one in Python as well to stretch out my knowledge in solving one answer using two different languages that does or does not have the same functions to them and then we also have a leetcode folder to also record possible challenges from leetcode. 


 this is to help me get better at learning and understanding how to code in two different languages and be better at problem solving in general to specific problems and situations.
